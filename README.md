# Test Files

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide easily accessible files for
common test cases.

When uploading test files to Filestack and other services, these files, or some
variation of them should be used.

Preceding the filename with `test-` makes it easier to identify whether the file
is necessary for someone looking through existing files.
